"""Lazy NeMo install — single source of truth for the Parakeet fallback path.

Why this exists:
  We don't want `nemo_toolkit[asr]` (~600 MB of deps including its own
  pinned torch / lightning / hydra) in the default install. 99% of users
  on an open network never need it — Whisper-large-v3 downloads cleanly
  from HuggingFace and the Parakeet fallback never fires.

  But for the 1% behind a corporate proxy that blocks HF, the fallback
  needs to "just work" on first run without making them hunt for an
  install command. So we shell out to pip the FIRST time the Parakeet
  lane is invoked, then cache the import for the rest of the process.

Called from:
  - `parakeet_lane._build_parakeet_model`  (primary call site)

NOT called from `whisper_lane.py` directly — the fallback there imports
`parakeet_lane` which in turn calls into here. Single chain, no
duplicate install attempts.
