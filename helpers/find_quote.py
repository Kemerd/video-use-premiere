"""Word-precise quote / range crawler for Parakeet transcripts.

Why this exists
===============

The editor sub-agent reads two markdown views end-to-end every spawn —
`<edit>/audiovisual_timeline.md` (audio + visual lanes interleaved) and
`<edit>/speech_timeline.md` (phrase-grouped transcripts with outer-
aligned `floor(start)..ceil(end)` integer ranges). Both views are
deliberately **token-cheap**: speech is grouped into phrase lines, time
is rounded to whole seconds, and the per-word boundary information
that lives in `<edit>/transcripts/<stem>.json` is dropped on the way
into the markdown. That trade-off is correct for *reading* the
timelines but useless when the editor has to set an actual EDL
in/out point — Hard Rule 6 demands cuts land on word boundaries, and
those boundaries are sub-second.

Historically, the editor's only path was "open the transcripts JSON
and grep / hand-walk the words[] array." That works but is slow,
error-prone, off-by-one prone, and burns context on JSON noise the
editor doesn't need (`type: "spacing"` rows, full duration headers,
etc.). This helper replaces that step with a single CLI call:

    python helpers/find_quote.py \\
        --edit-dir <edit> \\
        --clip DJI_20250214214221_0176_D \\
        --range 0:02-0:18 \\
        --quote "fabricate a hook"

Returns one JSON blob per match, with the bracketing words pinned to
the millisecond:

    {
      "clip": "DJI_20250214214221_0176_D",
      "query": {"quote": "fabricate a hook", "range_s": [2.0, 18.0]},
      "match_count": 1,
      "matches": [
        {
          "first_word": {"text": "fabricate", "start": 1.166, "end": 1.822},
          "last_word":  {"text": "hook.",     "start": 2.508, "end": 3.198},
          "prev_word":  {"text": "to",        "start": 1.021, "end": 1.166},
          "next_word":  {"text": "But",       "start": 4.418, "end": 5.246},
          "words":      [...sequence the editor matched...],
          "text":       "fabricate A hook.",
          "speaker_id": null
        }
      ]
    }

The editor reads `first_word.start` as the in-point candidate and
`last_word.end` as the out-point candidate, then applies the pacing
preset's lead/trail margins (with the next_word.start / prev_word.end
clamp to leave 60ms for the `afade` pair) and emits the EDL range.
No greps. No off-by-one. No partial JSON parses.

Calling shapes
==============

    # 1. Quote-only (no range filter, hits all matches across the clip).
    find_quote.py --edit-dir <edit> --clip <stem> --quote "lock in"

    # 2. Quote bounded by a speech_timeline.md integer range. The range
    #    is OUTER-ALIGNED — start floors, end ceils — so it always
    #    contains the actual float span. Pass it verbatim.
    find_quote.py --edit-dir <edit> --clip <stem> \\
                  --range 0:02-0:18 --quote "lock in"

    # 3. Range-only — return every word inside the range, plus the
    #    bracketing prev/next. Useful when the editor wants to see the
    #    full sub-second word stream for a phrase.
    find_quote.py --edit-dir <edit> --clip <stem> --range 0:02-0:18

    # 4. Default clip — when --clip is omitted, picks the most recently
    #    modified transcript JSON in <edit>/transcripts/. Convenient
    #    for the "last clip we talked about" case.
    find_quote.py --edit-dir <edit> --quote "lock in"

Time arguments accept `M:SS`, `MM:SS`, `H:MM:SS`, integer seconds, or
floating-point seconds (e.g. `1.234`). The integer-rounded ranges out
of `speech_timeline.md` are always safe to pass through.

Performance
===========

A typical 80-second clip transcript (~700 words) is under 60KB on
disk; `json.load` plus the sliding-window match runs in well under
5ms on cold cache, sub-millisecond hot. The script avoids regex
backtracking entirely — quote matching is a deterministic word-by-
word sweep with cheap punctuation/casefold normalisation. Memory is
linear in the number of words[] entries (no copies of the whole
JSON object) and bounded by one transcript at a time.

The helper is self-contained: no third-party dependencies, no model
loads, no network calls. Safe to invoke from any sub-agent context
without warming up a venv.
