"""Pack the three lane outputs into Claude-readable timeline markdowns.

After preprocess[_batch].py finishes, every video has THREE JSON files:

    <edit>/transcripts/<stem>.json   — parakeet_onnx_lane (speech, word level)
    <edit>/audio_tags/<stem>.json    — audio_lane         (CLAP vocab events)
    <edit>/visual_caps/<stem>.json   — visual_lane        (Florence-2 captions)

This script fans those out into FOUR markdown timelines that the SKILL
points Claude at:

    <edit>/speech_timeline.md   — phrase-grouped transcripts (per file)
    <edit>/audio_timeline.md    — vocab-scored sound events  (per file)
    <edit>/visual_timeline.md   — 1-second captions, dedup'd (per file)
    <edit>/merged_timeline.md   — all three lanes interleaved by timestamp

`merged_timeline.md` is the **default reading surface** for the editor
sub-agent: one file, every event in chronological order, so the agent
can plan cuts in a single pass instead of cross-referencing three lanes
by hand. The per-lane files remain on disk as drill-down references
(use them when you need only one lane, or when an ambiguity in the
merged view warrants zooming in on the raw per-lane data).

The interleaved merged view looks like:

    [00:12:04] "okay now we're going to drill the pilot holes"
    [00:12:09] (audio: cordless drill 0.42, drill press 0.31)
    [00:12:09] visual: a person holding a cordless drill above a metal panel
    [00:12:18] "good, pass me the deburring tool"

The phrase-grouping logic for speech_timeline.md is reused verbatim from
the old pack_transcripts.py so existing prompts that reference packed
transcripts continue to work — only the filename changed.

The audio lane emits PANNs-shape (label, score) events scored by a CLAP
encoder against a vocabulary list (see helpers/audio_lane.py). For
backward compatibility with caches still on disk from the abandoned
Audio Flamingo 3 migration, a separate caption-shape renderer is kept
behind a `model` sniff and removed once those caches age out.

CLI:
    python helpers/pack_timelines.py --edit-dir <dir> [--no-merge]

By default emits all four files. Pass `--no-merge` to skip the unified
view (rare — only useful when the per-lane files are all you want).

# Compact M:SS / H:MM:SS form across all four timeline files. The hour
# slot is omitted whenever it would be zero (a 90-second clip reads as
# `1:30`, not `0:01:30`) and the leading minute is unpadded so 1- and
# 2-digit minute values both look natural (`5:42` not `05:42`,
# `10:32` not `10:32`). Surrounding `[…]` brackets that the older
# pack_timelines used are dropped on purpose now: every event line
# already wears a type-disambiguating wrapper (`"…"` for speech,
# `(…)` for audio, `[…]` for visual), so an extra bracket pair on the
# timestamp would just be noise the editor sub-agent has to skip.
#
# All timeline writers below funnel through `_fmt_ts` for a single
# event timestamp and `_fmt_range` for `start-end` spans. Use whole
# seconds throughout — sub-second precision was used by the legacy
# format but the editor works in whole-second cut planning anyway, and
# whole seconds round-trip cleanly to the M:SS display without ugly

# Visual caption cleanup + fuzzy sentence-level delta dedup.
#
# Florence-2's `<MORE_DETAILED_CAPTION>` task emits a 5-7 sentence paragraph
# per frame at 1 fps. Two consecutive frames in static / slow-moving footage
# describe almost the same scene — same wires, same room, same colours —
# but vary by a sentence or two ("yellow panel on the top right" vs
# "yellow panel on the top corner"). The visual_lane dedup is byte-exact,
# so it only collapses literally identical captions; near-duplicates all
# survive into the merged timeline and bloat it by 5-10x.
#
# The fix is sentence-level delta dedup with fuzzy matching:
#
#   * Split each caption into sentences (clean period-space split — no
#     real tokenizer, Florence captions don't use abbreviations).
#   * For each new caption, compare its sentences (normalized) against
#     the previous caption's sentences using difflib SequenceMatcher.
#     A sentence with ratio >= 0.85 vs any prior sentence counts as
#     "already seen" — colour swaps, minor word reorderings, and
#     phrasing drift don't count as new content.
#   * If every sentence is already seen → render as `(same)`.
#   * If no sentences are shared → likely shot change, full caption.
#   * Otherwise → emit only the new sentences with a `+ ` prefix
#     (think `git diff` additions).
#
# The "previous" baseline always tracks the FULL current caption's
# sentence set, not just the delta we emitted — so deltas don't compound
# (a 1-sentence drift per frame doesn't accumulate into a misleading
# claim that nothing has changed in 60 frames).
