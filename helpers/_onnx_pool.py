"""Multi-session ONNX Runtime pool for parallel speech recognition.

Loads N independent `onnx_asr` model instances at startup, each with
its own `onnxruntime.InferenceSession` handle. ORT releases the GIL
during its native `Run()` call, so a `ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=N)`
dispatching to N threads ⇒ N truly-parallel native inferences on the
GPU: one session per worker, isolated CUDA streams, shared model
weights duplicated per session (Parakeet TDT 0.6B is small enough
that this is fine — at fp16 each duplicate is ~1.2 GB resident).

Why a pool, not a queue:
    A single InferenceSession can only Run() one request at a time —
    internally it serializes Run() calls behind a per-session mutex.
    Multiple sessions on the same GPU CAN run concurrently because
    each holds its own CUDA stream; the device's hardware scheduler
    overlaps them as long as we have unused SMs and unused VRAM
    bandwidth. For Parakeet (which is encoder-bottlenecked and only
    uses ~30% of a 5090's SMs per inference) we get near-linear
    scaling up to N=8.

VRAM-aware sizing:
    The caller passes a *desired* pool size (from `wealthy.py`). At
    construction we probe `vram.detect_gpu().free_gb` and clamp the
    actual pool size down if the desired N would overflow VRAM. The
    per-session footprint constants live in this module rather than
    `vram.py` because they're ONNX-specific (NeMo's torch-mode
    Parakeet has a totally different memory profile).

Public API:
    pool = OnnxSessionPool(model_id="nemo-parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2",
                           desired_size=4)
    results = pool.transcribe_batch([wav1, wav2, wav3, ...])
    pool.close()  # release sessions explicitly (or let GC do it)

Each result is the raw `TimestampedResult` (or `TimestampedSegmentResult`
list) that `onnx_asr` returns; the lane module is responsible for
canonicalizing it into the project's word/spacing JSON shape.

    """N independent onnx_asr models, one per worker thread.

    Lifecycle:
        1. `__init__` resolves the EP ladder, clamps pool size to fit
           VRAM, and constructs N model instances eagerly. Construction
           cost is paid once — each session does its own ORT init +
           weight load (~1-2s on a warm filesystem cache).
        2. `transcribe_batch(wavs)` fans out across the N sessions via
           a ThreadPoolExecutor. Each worker pulls one wav at a time.
        3. `close()` drops the session refs, runs gc, and (if torch
           is around) calls cuda.empty_cache to nudge the allocator.

    Thread safety:
        Each InferenceSession is single-Run-at-a-time internally, so
        we never share a session across threads. The Queue-of-sessions
        below ensures every worker grabs one session, runs, returns
        it. `transcribe_batch` is itself NOT reentrant — call it from
        a single thread.
