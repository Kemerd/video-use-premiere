"""Speech lane (fallback): NVIDIA Parakeet TDT v3 transcription via NeMo.

This module is a drop-in fallback for `whisper_lane.py` when the
HuggingFace Whisper download is blocked by a corporate proxy (NVIDIA
intranet, restricted enterprise networks, etc.). It produces the EXACT
SAME output JSON shape as `whisper_lane.py` so `pack_timelines.py`,
`render.py`, and the rest of the pipeline are completely unaware that a
different acoustic model produced the words.

Why Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3:
  * ~10x faster than whisper-large-v3 on the same GPU (RNNT decoder).
  * Native word-level timestamps (no extra forced-alignment step).
  * English + 24 European languages (sufficient for most editing work).
  * Distributed via NeMo's HuggingFace AND NGC mirrors — even if HF is
    walled off, NVIDIA's own NGC catalog is reachable from inside the
    NVIDIA corporate network.
  * No "hallucination on silence" failure mode that plagues Whisper.

The lazy NeMo install is handled in `_lazy_nemo.py` so this module's
top-level import surface stays cheap (no `import nemo` until we
actually need to build the model).

Output JSON shape (identical to whisper_lane.py — see that file's
docstring for the canonical schema):

    {
      "model": "nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3",
      "language": "en",
      "duration": 43.0,
      "text": "...full plain transcript...",
      "words": [
        {"type": "word", "text": "Ninety", "start": 2.52, "end": 2.78,
         "speaker_id": null},
        {"type": "spacing", "text": " ", "start": 2.78, "end": 2.81},
        ...
      ],
      "sample_rate": 16000
    }

Diarization: this lane intentionally re-uses the exact same
`_diarize_and_assign(...)` helper from `whisper_lane.py`. Speaker
attribution operates on the canonical word list, not the model — so
the moment we have words on a shared timeline, the diarizer doesn't
care whether they came from Whisper or Parakeet.
