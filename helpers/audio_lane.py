"""Audio lane: LAION CLAP via ONNX Runtime -> vocab-scored sound events.

Why CLAP, why ONNX, why an agent-curated vocabulary
---------------------------------------------------
The two predecessors of this module both lived in the same repo at one
time or another and both had the same fundamental problem: they shipped
with a fixed answer space that was either too small or too generic for
the kind of footage the rest of this skill targets.

  * `panns_inference.AudioTagger` (CNN14 trained on AudioSet) gave us a
    closed 527-class ontology where workshop / friction textures sit in
    the long tail of the published 43% mAP. Real failures: a clean
    sanding pass surfaced as "Goat bleating" because the spectro-temporal
    envelope of coarse abrasion lined up uncomfortably well with one
    weakly-labelled livestock sample. The ontology also literally cannot
    represent things that matter for editing (no "cordless drill driving
    a screw", no "router on plywood"). Discontinued.

  * `nvidia/audio-flamingo-3-hf` (a 7B audio-LLM that GENERATES natural
    language captions) solved the vocabulary problem, but at the cost of
    a ~14-18 GB resident weight footprint per chunk and ~3-8 s of
    decoder time PER 30s window. Co-tenanting it with Whisper + Florence
    on a 24 GB card became impossible; even sequentially it dominated
    end-to-end wall time for a feature whose output is supposed to be
    advisory context, not the editor's primary signal. Discontinued.

CLAP (Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining, LAION) is the natural
middle ground. It's a dual-encoder zero-shot model: an audio tower
embeds an audio chunk into a 512-d vector, a text tower embeds an
arbitrary phrase into the same space, and cosine similarity scores
the match. We pre-encode a vocabulary of label phrases ONCE per video
inventory and then every per-window inference is a single ~50ms audio
encoder forward pass + a dot product against the cached text matrix.

The vocabulary itself comes from one of two sources:

  1. The baked-in default in `audio_vocab_default.py` (~250 cross-domain
     labels covering speech-adjacent / workshop / nature / urban /
     household / music / sports / SFX). Good first cut for any video.
  2. A per-project vocabulary list authored by the Claude Code agent
     after Phase A preprocessing produces `speech_timeline.md` and
     `visual_timeline.md`. The agent reads those, infers what kinds
     of sounds plausibly appear in THIS specific video, and writes a
     hand-curated `<edit>/audio_vocab.txt` (one label per line, blank
     lines and `#` comments allowed). Re-running the audio lane with
     `--vocab <edit>/audio_vocab.txt --force` produces sharper labels
     because the score competition only happens between phrases the
     agent has reason to believe are in the audio.

Model tiers
-----------
  * Default ("base"):   `Xenova/clap-htsat-unfused`     (~150 MB ONNX,
                        LAION CLAP HTSAT-unfused, mAP 0.463 zero-shot
                        on AudioSet). Fast, fits on every consumer GPU.
  * Wealthy ("large"):  `Xenova/larger_clap_general`    (~600 MB ONNX,
                        sharper text encoder, slightly better fine-grain
                        discrimination). Selected automatically when
                        --wealthy / VIDEO_USE_WEALTHY=1.

Both are pre-converted ONNX exports of the original LAION torch weights;
they ship audio + text encoders as separate ONNX graphs so we can run
the text tower exactly once per vocab change and amortize that cost
across every video in the batch.

Sliding-window cadence
----------------------
HTSAT was pre-trained on 10s mel windows. We use:

    WINDOW_S = 10.0   # native HTSAT receptive field
    HOP_S    = 5.0    # 50% overlap; gives 5s temporal grain

Anything shorter (PANNs used 1s windows) requires zero-padding the
spectrogram, which the CLAP encoder reads as silence between transient
events and silently degrades discrimination on short bursts. 10s/5s is
the sweet spot for cross-domain editorial context — fine enough to
localize a tool burst, coarse enough that the encoder sees its native
input distribution.

ONNX execution provider ladder
------------------------------
Reuses `_onnx_providers.resolve_providers(prefer_tensorrt=False)`. We
explicitly skip TensorRT here because CLAP's audio + text graphs are
small enough that ORT-CUDA hits the GPU's compute roof at the first
batch — TRT's 2-5 minute engine compile cost dwarfs any per-window
speedup. Power users on long-running services can flip
VIDEO_USE_PARAKEET_TRT=1 (the same env var the speech lane reads) and
the ladder will include TRT, but it's NOT recommended for one-shot
preprocess runs.

JSON shape (per video)
----------------------
    {
      "model":      "Xenova/clap-htsat-unfused",
      "vocab_sha":  "0a1b2c3d4e5f6789",
      "vocab_size": 247,
      "window_s":   10.0,
      "hop_s":      5.0,
      "threshold":  0.10,
      "top_k":      5,
      "duration":   263.4,
      "events": [
        {"start": 12.0, "end": 22.0, "label": "drill",    "score": 0.421},
        {"start": 18.5, "end": 28.5, "label": "laughter", "score": 0.387}
      ]
    }

Cache invalidation
------------------
A cached JSON is reused only when ALL of:
  (a) JSON mtime is fresh vs the source video
  (b) JSON `model` field equals the current model id
  (c) JSON `vocab_sha` field equals the current sha256(model_id + vocab)

That third clause is what makes the agent vocab workflow safe: re-run
with a different `--vocab` file and every cache invalidates cleanly,
no `--force` needed. Old AF3 caches (`"nvidia/audio-flamingo-3-hf"`)
and orphan PANNs caches (`"PANNs CNN14 / AudioSet"`) both fail check
(b) and re-tag transparently on the first run after this lane lands.
