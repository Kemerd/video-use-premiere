"""ONNX Runtime execution-provider ladder.

Builds the ranked `providers=...` list passed to every
`onnxruntime.InferenceSession` we construct in the speech lane. The
contract:

  * Try the fastest backend first.
  * Each backend gets its own per-EP option dict (TRT workspace, fp16
    flags, CUDA arena enable, etc.).
  * If a backend isn't installed / can't initialise, fall through to
    the next tier WITHOUT crashing the caller.
  * Always end with `CPUExecutionProvider` so any model is at least
    runnable.

Ladder, fastest-to-most-portable:

Why TensorRT is gated rather than auto-on:
    The TRT EP compiles an engine on the FIRST forward pass for every
    new (model, input-shape) combination. That compile takes 2-5
    minutes and writes a multi-MB engine cache to disk. For one-shot
    transcribe jobs the compile dominates wall time; for long-running
    services the amortized cost is fine. We let the user opt in
    explicitly so they're not surprised by a 5-minute first-run hang
    when they thought CUDA EP was already fast enough (it usually is).

Why CUDA -> DirectML -> CPU rather than CUDA -> CPU:
    DirectML beats CPU by 2-3x on Intel Arc / Iris Xe and AMD APUs,
    which a non-trivial slice of "video editor" users have. On systems
    where DML isn't available the import probe fails cheaply and we
    fall through to CPU.

# NVIDIA DLL bootstrap (Windows only)
#
# The `tensorrt-cu12-libs` and `nvidia-cudnn-cu12` pip packages ship the
# native runtime DLLs (nvinfer_10.dll, cudnn64_9.dll, etc.) inside their
# site-packages folders, but they do NOT register those folders with the
# OS loader. Result: when `onnxruntime`'s provider bridge calls
# `LoadLibraryW("onnxruntime_providers_cuda.dll")`, the OS looks for its
# transitive deps (`cudnn64_9.dll`, `nvinfer_10.dll`) on PATH and the
# Python-visible DLL search dirs — neither of which contains them — and
# fails with WinError 126 ("specified module could not be found"). ORT
# silently falls back to CPU EP, so users get ~20x RTFx instead of the
# 200-300x the CUDA/TRT EP would have delivered.
#
# Two-pronged fix is required, learned the hard way:
#
#   1. `os.add_dll_directory()` — covers DLLs the Python interpreter
#      itself loads. Necessary but not sufficient: ORT's provider
#      bridge uses `LoadLibraryW` with the default search path which
#      bypasses DLL directories added via the `AddDllDirectory` API on
#      some Windows builds (depends on whether the EP DLL is loaded
#      with `LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_*` flags or default semantics).
#
#   2. PATH prepend — guarantees the OS loader sees the directories no
#      matter how the EP DLL was loaded. The classic workaround that
#      every Windows-based ORT user eventually rediscovers.
#
# Both pip packages need to be visible:
#   * tensorrt_libs/                 (nvinfer_10.dll + plugin DLLs)
#   * nvidia/cudnn/bin/              (cudnn64_9.dll + cnn/ops DLLs)
#
# We do this at module import time so any caller of `resolve_providers`
# is guaranteed to get a working EP. Idempotent — repeated import is a
# no-op via a module-level "done" flag.

    # ── Phase 2.5: pin cuDNN + TRT sub-libs to ONE directory ────────────
    #
    # Why this exists (the ONNXRuntime / cuDNN 9 split-library trap):
    #
    #   cuDNN 9.x is no longer a monolithic `cudnn64_9.dll`. The vendor
    #   shipped it as a tiny dispatcher (`cudnn64_9.dll`) plus a fleet of
    #   per-domain sub-libs that the dispatcher loads on first use:
    #
    #     cudnn_cnn64_9.dll                       ← BatchNorm/Conv kernels
    #     cudnn_ops64_9.dll                       ← reductions, softmax
    #     cudnn_adv64_9.dll                       ← attention, RNN
    #     cudnn_graph64_9.dll                     ← graph API runtime
    #     cudnn_engines_precompiled64_9.dll       ← shipped engine cache
    #     cudnn_engines_runtime_compiled64_9.dll  ← JIT engine builder
    #     cudnn_heuristic64_9.dll                 ← engine picker
    #
    #   Each sub-lib carries a build-version tag and the dispatcher will
    #   reject sub-libs whose tag does not match its own with the
    #   error the user actually saw on the CLAP audio encoder:
    #
    #     CUDNN failure 1002: CUDNN_STATUS_SUBLIBRARY_VERSION_MISMATCH
    #     expr=cudnnCreateTensorDescriptor(&tensor_)
    #
    #   This crash is non-deterministic across models because different
    #   ops route to different sub-libs — Parakeet + Florence happened
    #   not to hit BatchNormalization, CLAP's audio encoder does on its
    #   first node. Any op that touches `cudnn_cnn64_9.dll` will trip.
    #
    # Why "just prepend PATH" was not enough:
    #
    #   Prepending PATH only steers the FIRST `LoadLibraryW("cudnn64_9.dll")`
    #   call. cuDNN's dispatcher then loads each sub-lib via its OWN
    #   `LoadLibrary` call which uses default search semantics — those
    #   may resolve from:
    #     * a DIFFERENT cuDNN install bundled with PyTorch
    #       (`site-packages/torch/lib/`) whose dir is on PATH because the
    #       user `import torch`'d earlier in the session,
    #     * an older system-wide CUDA Toolkit cuDNN under
    #       `%CUDA_PATH%\bin\`,
    #     * Windows' module-search-cache for any sub-lib already mapped
    #       into the process (NeMo, TF, OnnxRuntime-DirectML all ship
    #       partial cuDNN copies).
    #   Result: dispatcher is wheel-version 9.x.A, sub-lib loaded is
    #   torch-bundled 9.x.B → mismatch → crash mid-inference.
    #
    # The fix that actually holds:
    #
    #   Walk our chosen cuDNN bin dir, find EVERY `cudnn*64_9.dll` in it,
    #   and `LoadLibraryW` each one BY ABSOLUTE PATH at bootstrap. Once
    #   a DLL is mapped into the process by absolute path, the OS loader
    #   short-circuits any subsequent `LoadLibrary("cudnn_cnn64_9.dll")`
    #   call (regardless of how the caller searches) to our pre-mapped
    #   handle. Every sub-lib is now guaranteed to come from the same
    #   directory and therefore the same build tag.
    #
    #   We do the same for TRT plugin DLLs so a future CLAP-on-TRT user
    #   doesn't get bitten by the equivalent split-plugin trap.
    #
    # Cost: one ctypes.WinDLL per sub-lib at import time. Total < 50ms
    # on a warm filesystem; the libs would have been mapped within the
    # first inference call anyway, we're just doing it deterministically
    # and from the right directory. Idempotent — Windows refcounts
    # module loads, so re-loading is a no-op handle-bump.

    See the long-form rationale at the call-site in

    DLL (`cudnn64_9.dll`) loads sub-libraries (`cudnn_cnn64_9.dll`,
    `cudnn_ops64_9.dll`, ...) lazily via its own LoadLibrary calls.

    or CUDA-Toolkit-shipped copies whose build tags don't match the
    dispatcher we picked, crashing with
    `CUDNN_STATUS_SUBLIBRARY_VERSION_MISMATCH` mid-inference.

    Strategy:
        1. Locate the wheel's cuDNN dir (`nvidia/cudnn/bin/`).
        2. `ctypes.WinDLL(absolute_path)` every `cudnn*64_9.dll` in it.
           Loading by absolute path bypasses the search order entirely

           failure mode would bite us on multi-graph TRT runs.
        4. Repeat for the `nvidia/cublas/bin/` dir — cuBLAS also ships
           a few sub-libs (cublasLt, cublasLt-internal) that benefit
           from the same pinning strategy.

    Failures are non-fatal: a single sub-lib that fails to load gets a
    one-line diagnostic and we keep going. Worst case we revert to the
