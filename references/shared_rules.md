# Shared Rules — every agent in this skill reads this first

Every agent operating inside the `video-use-premiere` skill — the parent
conversation manager AND every sub-agent it spawns (editor, vocab,
animations) — reads this file as step 0 before doing anything else. The
rules here are **universal**: they bind production correctness, the agent
hierarchy, and the philosophy that lets the skill do its job without
silent failures.

After reading this file, continue to your role-specific rules:

- Parent agent: `references/parent_rules.md`
- Editor sub-agent: `references/subagent_editor_rules.md`
- Vocab sub-agent: `references/subagent_vocab_rules.md`
- Animation sub-agent: `references/animations.md`

If you do not know which role you are, you are the parent. Sub-agents are
told their role explicitly by the parent in their spawn brief.

## Principle

1. **LLM reasons from one interleaved markdown view + on-demand drill-down.**
   `merged_timeline.md` is the editor sub-agent's default reading surface
   — speech phrases, audio events, and visual captions for every source,
   all interleaved chronologically by timestamp in a single file. The
   three per-lane views (`speech_timeline.md`, `audio_timeline.md`,
   `visual_timeline.md`) are kept on disk as drill-down references for the
   moments where the merged view is ambiguous and the editor needs to zoom
   in on one lane. Everything else — filler tagging, retake detection,
   shot classification, B-roll spotting, emphasis scoring — is derived at
   decision time.

2. **Speech is primary, visuals are secondary, audio events are tertiary.**
   Cut candidates come from Parakeet ONNX speech boundaries and silence
   gaps — that lane is highly accurate and is the editorial spine. Visual
   captions (Florence-2) are the second source of truth: they answer
   "what's actually on screen here?" and resolve ambiguous decision points
   (B-roll spotting, shot continuity, action beats). Audio events (CLAP,
   zero-shot scoring against an agent-curated vocabulary) tag non-speech
   sounds per ~10s window. When audio and visual disagree about *what is
   happening on screen*, **trust the visual lane.**

3. **Ask -> confirm -> execute -> iterate -> persist.** No agent ever
   touches a cut, a vocabulary, or a render until the user has confirmed
   the strategy in plain English. The parent handles the conversation;
   sub-agents only run after the parent has dispatched them.

4. **Generalize.** Do not assume what kind of video this is. Look at the
   material, ask the user, then edit.

5. **Artistic freedom is the default.** Every specific value, preset,
   font, color, duration, pitch structure, and technique in this skill is
   a *worked example* from one proven video — not a mandate. Read them to
   understand what's possible and why each worked. Then make taste calls
   based on what the material actually is and what the user actually
   wants. **The only things you MUST do are in the Hard Rules block
   below.** Everything else is yours.

6. **Invent freely.** If the material calls for a technique not described
   in the role files — split-screen, picture-in-picture, lower-third
   identity cards, reaction cuts, freeze frames, match cuts, speed ramps
   over breath, whatever — build it. The helpers are ffmpeg and PIL; the
   FCPXML exporter handles hard-cut delivery to NLEs. They can do anything
   the format supports. Do not wait for permission. (Note: J-cuts, L-cuts,
   and cross-dissolves are currently DEFERRED — see Hard Rule 14.)

7. **Verify your own output before showing it upstream.** If you wouldn't
   ship it, don't return it. The editor sub-agent verifies its own EDL
   against word-boundary discipline before returning. The vocab sub-agent
   verifies its own vocabulary covers the project's actual content before
   returning. The parent verifies the renderer's output against the
   self-eval checklist before showing the user.

## Agent roles (this binds harder than the Hard Rules below)

Three kinds of agent make this skill work. **They are not interchange-
able.** Token economy AND quality of output both depend on the boundary
holding. The parent agent must NEVER do a sub-agent's job, and a
sub-agent must never assume facts the parent didn't put in its brief.

### Parent agent — pure conversation manager, knows nothing about the video itself

- **Talks to the user.** Asks questions, confirms strategy, presents
  previews, takes feedback. This is the parent's only persistent state.
- **Reads `project.md`** at session start (compressed memory from prior
  sessions). That's the only timeline-adjacent file it ever opens
  directly.
- **Maintains a Conversation Context bundle** in its own working memory
  throughout the session, comprising:
    - A *complete* summary of the project in the parent's own words —
      what kind of video, who's in it, what it's for, target deliverable,
      aesthetic direction, must-keeps, must-cuts. **Comprehensive. No
      artificial word cap.** Length is whatever it needs to be.
    - A *list of verbatim user quotes*, chronological, capturing the
      original wording of every meaningful request, rejection, or
      preference. Direct quotes preserve nuance the parent cannot
      reliably paraphrase ("make it punchy" != "make it tight" != "cut
      it shorter"). When in doubt, quote. Tag each quote with a short
      context note (when in the session, what it was a response to).
    - Things the user *explicitly rejected* — also as quotes with
      context.
    - Things the user *explicitly asked to keep* — also as quotes with
      context.
- **Writes briefs. Spawns sub-agents.** The Conversation Context bundle
  is forwarded verbatim into every sub-agent brief — that is how
  iterative sub-agents have memory across spawns.
- **Reads sub-agent return values** (EDL JSON, vocab.txt, animation slot
  reports) and translates them back to the user in plain English.
- **NEVER reads `merged_timeline.md`, `speech_timeline.md`,
  `visual_timeline.md`, or `audio_timeline.md` directly.** The parent
  has no opinion on what the video shows. If the user asks "what's in
  clip C0103?", the parent answers "I don't know — let me ask the editor
  sub-agent" or spawns a tiny scout sub-agent. The parent never opens
  the timeline files.
- **NEVER edits `edl.json` by hand**, even for a "trivial" tweak the
  user asks for. Every change request, no matter how small, re-spawns
  the editor sub-agent with an updated brief. Hand-edits skip the
  word-boundary / pacing / filler discipline the editor's role rules
  enforce.
- **NEVER curates `audio_vocab.txt` by hand.** Vocab work belongs to
  the vocab sub-agent.
- **NEVER opens the source video files.** Not even with `ffprobe`-via-
  eyeball-of-a-frame. That is a sub-agent's job if it is needed at all.

### Vocab sub-agent — runs once per Phase B (and again after a vocab miss)

- Spawned by the parent in step 2 of the process.
- Reads `speech_timeline.md` + `visual_timeline.md` end-to-end, in full,
  with its own fresh context window.
- Receives the parent's Conversation Context bundle in its brief so the
  vocabulary actually matches what the user said the video is.
- Writes `<edit>/audio_vocab.txt` — 200-1000 short labels, project-
  specific, with a healthy negative set.
- Returns a complete report of what it inferred about the soundscape,
  the chosen vocabulary categories, and any ambiguous calls — no
  artificial length limit. The parent forwards salient bits to the
  user.

### Editor sub-agent — runs once per cut decision (every revision = a fresh spawn)

- Spawned by the parent in step 6 for the initial cut, and re-spawned
  in step 9 for every user-requested change without exception.
- Reads `merged_timeline.md` end-to-end (per the ABSOLUTE READ
  MANDATE in `subagent_editor_rules.md` and the spine principle of
  Hard Rule 15) in its own fresh context window. Drills into the
  per-lane files only at ambiguous moments.
- Receives from the parent in its brief:
    1. The full Conversation Context bundle (project summary +
       verbatim user quotes + rejections + must-keeps).
    2. Strategy: beats / structure, pacing preset values, target
       runtime, delivery target.
    3. Change-request history — chronological list of every cut
       revision the user has asked for so far, each as a verbatim
       quote with what was changed in the prior EDL in response.
    4. On revisions: the prior `edl.json` plus the user's specific
       change request quote for THIS revision.
- Writes `<edit>/edl.json`. Returns a one-line runtime check and a
  short rationale per beat.

### Animation sub-agents — one per slot, all spawned in parallel

- Spawned by the parent in step 6 alongside the editor sub-agent.
- See `references/animations.md` for the full brief template.

### What this means in practice

- A long iteration session does NOT bloat the parent's context with
  timeline data, because the parent never reads it. The parent's
  context grows linearly with conversation, not with file size.
- A sub-agent spawned on revision #5 has the same fresh window as one
  spawned on revision #1, plus the full change history in its brief.
  It is NOT operating with less context — it is operating with curated
  context plus a clean read budget.
- The parent's job is roughly: **listen -> summarize -> quote ->
  dispatch -> translate.** Nothing else. If you catch yourself reading
  a timeline file as the parent, stop — write the question into a sub-
  agent brief instead.

## Hard Rules (production correctness — non-negotiable)

These are the things where deviation produces silent failures or broken
output. They are not taste, they are correctness. Memorize them.

1. **Subtitles are applied LAST in the filter chain**, after every
   overlay. Otherwise overlays hide captions. Silent failure.

2. **Per-segment extract -> lossless `-c copy` concat**, not single-pass
   filtergraph. Otherwise every segment is double-encoded when overlays
   are added.

3. **30ms audio fades at every segment boundary**
   (`afade=t=in:st=0:d=0.03,afade=t=out:st={dur-0.03}:d=0.03`).
   Otherwise audible pops at every cut.

4. **Overlays use `setpts=PTS-STARTPTS+T/TB`** to shift the overlay's
   frame 0 to its window start. Otherwise the middle of the animation
   shows during the overlay window.

5. **Master SRT uses output-timeline offsets**:
   `output_time = word.start - segment_start + segment_offset`.
   Otherwise captions misalign after segment concat.

6. **Never cut inside a word.** Snap every cut edge to a word boundary
   from the Parakeet word-level transcript.

7. **Pad every cut edge.** Working window: 30-200ms. ASR timestamps
   drift 50-100ms — padding absorbs the drift. Tighter for fast-paced,
   looser for cinematic.

8. **Word-level verbatim ASR only.** Parakeet TDT emits per-token
   timestamps natively — keep them; never collapse to phrase / SRT shape
   on the lane output (that loses sub-second gap data). Never normalize
   fillers either (loses editorial signal — the editor sub-agent uses
   `umm` / `uh` / false starts to find candidate cuts).

9. **Cache lane outputs per source.** Never re-run a lane unless the
   source file itself changed (mtime). The orchestrator handles this;
   do not pass `--force` reflexively.

10. **Parallel sub-agents for multiple animations.** Never sequential.
    Spawn N at once via the `Agent` / `Task` tool; total wall time
    approx slowest one.

11. **Strategy confirmation before execution.** No sub-agent runs until
    the user has approved the plain-English plan via the parent.

12. **All session outputs in `<videos_dir>/edit/`.** Never write inside
    the `video-use-premiere/` project directory.

13. **Pacing preset is REQUIRED before strategy.** Every session must
    have a pacing preset confirmed by the user (Calm / Measured / Paced
    / Energetic / Jumpy — default Paced). The preset defines four
    numbers used by the editor sub-agent: `min_silence_to_remove`,
    `min_talk_to_keep`, `lead_margin`, and `trail_margin`. See
    `parent_rules.md` for the value table. Never skip the prompt;
    never invent ad-hoc values.

14. **No split edits (J/L cuts) and no cross-dissolves until further
    notice.** The editor sub-agent MUST emit `audio_lead = video_tail
    = transition_in = 0` on every range. They are deferred because the
    OTIO single-track audio model + per-clip independent frame-snapping
    causes cumulative audio drift across long timelines (visible as
    the audio sliding further out of sync with each subsequent cut).
    Audio at cut boundaries is protected by the 30ms `afade` pair from
    Hard Rule 3 — that is the current "small crossfade" story.

15. **The merged view is the editor's spine — never edit from a
    single lane in isolation.** Cut decisions read
    `merged_timeline.md` (all three lanes interleaved by timestamp)
    so speech (the spine), visual captions (shot continuity / B-
    roll), and audio events (soundscape hints) all inform every cut.
    A cut chosen blind to the other lanes will land mid-shot, mid-
    action, or on a CLAP mis-label. Drill into per-lane files only
    at ambiguous moments. The mandatory full-coverage read
    discipline for each sub-agent lives in its own rules file
    (`subagent_editor_rules.md` Pre-flight, `subagent_vocab_rules.md`
    Pre-flight) — those files are authoritative for what "read in
    full" means inside each role.

Everything outside the Hard Rules block is taste. Deviate whenever the
material calls for it.

---

## Universal anti-patterns

These fail regardless of role:

- **Hierarchical pre-computed codec formats** with USABILITY / tone tags
  / shot layers. Over-engineering. Derive from the timelines at decision
  time.
- **Hand-tuned moment-scoring functions.** The LLM picks better than
  any heuristic you can write.
- **SRT / phrase-level lane output.** Loses sub-second gap data. Always
  word-level verbatim from the speech lane.
- **Re-running `helpers/preprocess_batch.py --force` reflexively.** The
  mtime-based cache is correct; bypass only when the source actually
  changed or a model was upgraded.
- **Reading `transcripts/*.json` directly.** Use the timeline markdowns;
  same data, 1/10 the tokens, phrase-aligned.
- **Editing before confirming the strategy.** Never.
- **Re-preprocessing cached sources.** Immutable outputs of immutable
  inputs.
- **Assuming what kind of video it is.** Look first, ask second, edit
  last.
- **Sub-agent reading from a single lane in isolation when the merged
  view exists.** The merged view IS the default reading surface
  (Hard Rule 15). Per-lane files are drill-down only.
- **Parent agent reading any timeline file.** See "Agent roles" above
  — the architecture's whole point is timeline reads happen in fresh
  sub-agent windows, not the parent's accumulating one.
